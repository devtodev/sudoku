categorization

	Humans acquire this ability after many years of observing a wide-range of related examples. 
	skill based primarily on memory for past experiences rather than on logical deduction or symbolic reasoning 

	Associating one or more action with each of the categories.
	The problem solver has a large repertoire of well-practiced action routines that can be selected and applied 
	in a way that is appropriate for the initial categorization decision.


	General categorization rules within a supervised learning paradigm.


	These systems create a list of fixedlength condition-action rules that applie in parallel representing the
	presence or absence of specific features in the current enviroment.

	The three big parts of the systems are:

	1) A performance algorithm that comparing and activating rules
	2) A reinforcement algorithm that modifies the strength of each rule on basis of the "fitness" in the current enviroment
	3) A rule creation algorithm that generalizes examples or combines current rules to produce new ones
